## 📊 Architecture Overview

### File Structure
```
Notion Extension/
├── manifest.json (v2.0.0)
├── background.js (OAuth handling)
├── popup-enhanced.html (new entry point)
├── notion-oauth.js (authentication)
├── js/
│   ├── app-enhanced.js (main application)
│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── calendar-service.js (calendar management)
│   │   └── task-manager.js (task utilities)
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── calendar-view.js (calendar UI)
│   ├── ui/
│   │   └── ui-components.js (UI library)
│   └── testing/

│   └── ui-components.css (component styles)
└── icons/ (unchanged)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Authentication**: background.js → notion-oauth.js
2. **Database Management**: calendar-service.js ↔ Notion API
3. **UI Rendering**: app-enhanced.js → calendar-view.js → DOM
4. **State Management**: Chrome storage API

## 🔄 Notion Database Schema

Your extension creates two databases:

### Tasks Database (Phase 1)
- Task (Title)
- Status (Select)
- Priority (Select)
- Due Date (Date)
- Category (Select)
- Estimate (Number)
- Energy Level (Select)
- Context (Select)
- Description (Rich Text)
- Tags (Multi-select)
- Progress (Number)

### Calendar Events Database (Phase 2)
- Event Title (Title)
- Start Time (Date)
- End Time (Date)
- Status (Select)
- Priority (Select)
- Category (Select)
- Duration (Number)
- Energy Required (Select)
- Location (Rich Text)
- Attendees (Multi-select)
- Description (Rich Text)
- Related Task (Relation to Tasks)

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Implemented Optimizations
1. **Caching**: Database schemas and user preferences
2. **Lazy Loading**: Calendar events loaded on demand
3. **Debouncing**: API calls throttled to prevent rate limits
4. **Efficient Rendering**: Only update changed DOM elements
5. **Background Sync**: Minimal background processing

### Best Practices
- Limit calendar view to 1 month at a time
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Implement proper error handling

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **OAuth Tokens**: Stored securely in Chrome storage
2. **API Endpoints**: Only Notion API communication
3. **Data Privacy**: No third-party data sharing
4. **Permissions**: Minimal required permissions only
