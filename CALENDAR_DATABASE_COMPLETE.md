### 🔄 Complete CRUD Operations

**CREATE** - Full event creation with all fields:
```javascript
await calendarService.createCalendarEvent({
    title: "Team Meeting",
    startTime: new Date("2025-07-17T10:00:00"),
    endTime: new Date("2025-07-17T11:00:00"),
    type: "Meeting",
    priority: "High",
    attendees: ["Team Lead", "Developer"],
    location: "Conference Room A",
    meetingUrl: "https://zoom.us/j/123",
    // ... all other fields
});
```

**READ** - Advanced filtering and fetching:
```javascript
const events = await calendarService.getCalendarEvents(
    startDate, 
    endDate, 
    { 
        type: ["Meeting", "Work"], 
        priority: ["High"], 
        status: ["Scheduled", "Confirmed"] 
    }
);
```

**UPDATE** - Selective field updates:
```javascript
await calendarService.updateCalendarEvent(eventId, {
    status: "Completed",
    notes: "Meeting went well",
    endTime: new Date() // Auto-updated
});
```

**DELETE** - Safe archiving:
```javascript
await calendarService.deleteCalendarEvent(eventId);
```

### 🔄 Task-Calendar Integration

**Convert Tasks to Calendar Events:**
```javascript
// Automatic conversion with smart defaults
const event = await calendarService.convertTaskToCalendarEvent(taskId);

// Custom conversion with overrides
const event = await calendarService.convertTaskToCalendarEvent(taskId, {
    startTime: new Date("2025-07-17T14:00:00"),
    duration: 120, // 2 hours
    type: "Work",
    location: "Home Office"
});
```
