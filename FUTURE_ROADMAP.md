# 🚀 Notion Todo Extension - Future Roadmap

This document outlines planned enhancements and major features to be implemented in future versions of the Notion Todo Extension.

## 🎯 Major Enhancement Goals

### 1. 🔐 OAuth Authentication System
**Replace manual API-key entry with secure OAuth flow**

**Current State:** Users manually paste API keys and database IDs
**Future Goal:** Seamless OAuth login with Google/Notion accounts

#### Implementation Plan:
- [ ] Register extension as a Notion "Public Integration" (OAuth client)
- [ ] Integrate Chrome's Identity/OAuth APIs for consent screen
- [ ] Request minimal required scopes (read/write databases, pages)
- [ ] Implement secure token exchange on successful callback
- [ ] Store access tokens securely in `chrome.storage` or `chrome.identity.getAuthToken`
- [ ] Auto-include tokens in all Notion API requests
- [ ] Handle token refresh and re-consent for expired tokens
- [ ] Add logout functionality
- [ ] Implement error handling for OAuth failures

#### Benefits:
- ✅ Eliminates manual API key management
- ✅ More secure token handling
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Follows OAuth2 best practices
- ✅ Supports automatic token refresh

---

### 2. 🗄️ Auto-Database Creation & Management
**Automatically create and manage standardized task databases**

**Current State:** Users must manually create and configure Notion databases
**Future Goal:** Extension auto-creates optimized task databases

#### Implementation Plan:
- [ ] Call Notion's "create database" endpoint after OAuth
- [ ] Implement standardized schema:
  - Task name (Title)
  - Status (Status: Not started, In progress, Done, Blocked)
  - Priority (Select: Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
  - Due date (Date with time support)
  - Description (Rich text)
  - Created date (Created time)
  - Updated date (Last edited time)
- [ ] Allow users to choose parent page/workspace location
- [ ] Save database ID in `chrome.storage` for future operations
- [ ] Auto-detect missing database and recreate if needed
- [ ] Implement "Use existing database" fallback option
- [ ] Add database migration tools for schema updates
- [ ] Create database templates for different use cases

#### Benefits:
- ✅ Zero-configuration setup
- ✅ Consistent database schema
- ✅ Eliminates user setup errors
- ✅ Standardized property types
- ✅ Future-proof schema management

### 3. 🎨 Dynamic & Responsive UI System
**Transform static UI into adaptive, component-based system**

**Current State:** Hard-coded HTML/CSS with fixed layouts
**Future Goal:** Modular, responsive, theme-aware interface

#### Implementation Plan:

##### Schema-Driven Forms:
- [ ] Fetch database property schema via Notion API
- [ ] Generate form inputs dynamically based on schema
- [ ] Auto-create filter options from actual database values
- [ ] Support custom property types (rollup, formula, relation)
- [ ] Validate inputs based on property constraints

##### Component Architecture:
- [ ] Break popup into reusable widgets:
  - `TaskForm` - Add/edit task interface
  - `TaskList` - Display and manage tasks
  - `FiltersPanel` - Advanced filtering controls
  - `StatusBar` - Messages and loading states
  - `SettingsPanel` - Configuration interface
- [ ] Implement component lifecycle (mount, update, unmount)
- [ ] Add inter-component communication system
- [ ] Create component registry for dynamic loading

##### Theming & Responsiveness:
- [ ] Implement CSS custom properties for theming
- [ ] Add light/dark mode toggle with system preference detection
- [ ] Create responsive layouts for different popup sizes
- [ ] Support custom color schemes and fonts
- [ ] Add high contrast accessibility mode
- [ ] Implement fluid typography and spacing

##### Loading States & Performance:
- [ ] Add skeleton screens for loading states
- [ ] Implement progressive loading for large task lists
- [ ] Add virtual scrolling for performance
- [ ] Create smooth transitions and animations
- [ ] Optimize bundle size and loading times

##### Accessibility & Keyboard Support:
- [ ] Add proper ARIA roles and labels
- [ ] Implement complete keyboard navigation
- [ ] Add focus management and indicators
- [ ] Support screen readers
- [ ] Create high contrast mode
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions

##### Framework Integration:
- [ ] Evaluate lightweight frameworks (lit, Preact, Alpine.js)
- [ ] Implement reactive state management
- [ ] Add component-based templating
- [ ] Create development build system
- [ ] Add testing framework integration

#### Benefits:
- ✅ Adaptive to any Notion database schema
- ✅ Better maintainability and scalability
- ✅ Improved user experience
- ✅ Accessibility compliance
- ✅ Modern development practices

## 🤝 Contributing Guidelines

### Getting Started with Future Development
1. Review the current codebase and architecture
2. Choose a feature from the roadmap
3. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/oauth-implementation`
4. Implement with proper testing
5. Submit pull request with detailed description

### Development Priorities
1. **Security First**: All OAuth and token handling must be secure
2. **User Experience**: Focus on seamless, intuitive interactions
3. **Performance**: Maintain fast load times and smooth animations
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure all features work with assistive technologies
5. **Maintainability**: Write clean, documented, testable code

### Technical Standards

## 📝 Notes for Future Development

### Current Architecture Considerations
- Extension uses Manifest V3 (ensure compatibility)
- Chrome Storage API for persistence
- Content Security Policy compliance
- Notion API v2022-06-28 (check for updates)

### Breaking Changes to Plan For
- OAuth implementation will require manifest updates
- Database auto-creation changes storage schema
- Component architecture may require file restructuring
- Framework integration will need build system changes

### Migration Strategies
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain backward compatibility during transitions
- Provide migration tools for existing users
- Create fallback modes for new features
